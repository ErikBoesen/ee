I spoke with my supervisor today, Monday, April 30, 2018, to get a grounding in my sources.

The predominant element which pulled me toward research on neural networks was my fascination with the subject and desire to create a high-quality piece of literature through which I could teach myself new material within that subject area.

I have located several scientific primary sources, including one describing the original theory of deep learning through a neural network, and another describing the technique of language recognition using the neural network technique. I've also located sources describing other techniques for performing language recognition.

By far the most challenging part of this essay will be the raw implementation of the neural network to perform language recognition. I have already implemented a simple neural network, but it is only capable of learning to perform binary XOR/OR/AND operations and cannot do language recognition yet.
