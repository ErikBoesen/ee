I spoke with my supervisor today, Monday, April 30, 2018, to get a grounding in my sources. I sought, at the advice of Mrs. Jamie Sample, Mason's Extended Essay coordinator, to answer the following questions:

- What drew me to pursuing this topic?
- Which sources are most appropriate and why?
- What challenges or considerations will you need to address as you move forward?

To answer the first question, the predominant element which pulled me toward research on neural networks was my fascination with the subject and desire to create a high-quality piece of literature through which I could teach myself new material within that subject area. I have in the past experimented with machine learning techniques through helper libraries like ScikitLearn and Tensorflow, however, I had never taken the leap to building, from the ground up, my own neural network, complete with my own independent logic and experimentation. According to psychologist Annie Murphy Paul, students are better able to learn new material if they proceed through the process of educating others about that topic. Hence, I have set forward with the goal of creating instructional, yet still innovative, research within the field I've selected.

I have located several scientific primary sources, including one describing the original theory of deep learning through a neural network, and another describing the technique of language recognition using the neural network technique. I've also located sources describing other techniques for performing language recognition, which I plan to cite as examples while comparing different strategies for achieving this end. My supervisor mentioned that I should take care to cite any sources I use which contain code advising me on how to implement my neural network. I will make sure to do this both retroactively and moving forward.

By far the most challenging part of this essay will be the raw implementation of the neural network to perform language recognition. I have already implemented a simple neural network, but it is only capable of learning to perform binary XOR/OR/AND operations and cannot do language recognition yet. I expect the documentation of the logic I use to be relatively intuitive. Something else I do need to work on, as aforementioned, is sourcing: when creating extended essays in Computer Science, it can be sometimes difficult to accurately document from where information is derived as Computer Science is a field in which work is based often on existing knowledge and not on citation. Unlike in, for example, chemistry, where it is intuitive to cite sources for the most rudimentary of facts, the average programmer's job does not involve rigorous citation of every source of knowledge put into creating a working product.
