# Extended Essay
This is the [Extended Essay](https://www.ibo.org/programmes/diploma-programme/curriculum/extended-essay/) I wrote to earn my [IB Diploma](https://www.ibo.org/globalassets/publications/become-an-ib-school/ibdp_en.pdf) in [Group 4 (Sciences)](https://blog.prepscholar.com/the-complete-list-of-ib-courses-and-classes#group4).

The essay, typeset in LaTeX, can be found within `essay.tex`, and my cited sources are in `research.bib`.

Within `code` are located all the Python programs used for experimentation. The purposes of individual files are explained in Appendices to the essay.

`cpp_code` contains C++ files initially used for implementing a neural network. I didn't end up using this implementation in the end and it doesn't work.

Photos of the feedback I received from my supervisor can be found in `feedback`.

My EE reflections are written in `reflections`.
