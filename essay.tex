\section{Introduction}
This is where the introduction goes.

\section{A general overview of neural networks}
\subsection{Why use Neural Networks?}
% TODO: Review "categorized" word choice, check on how K Nearest Neighbors works
Neural Networks (NNs) are a common technique used in Machine Learning (ML). ML techniques are useful when a large and diverse set of data must be processed and categorized, but writing explicit code to make distinctions between data points would be impractical. For example, when identifying objects in an image [cite that MIT-cited study about object categorization that brought NNs into the spotlight], it would be nearly impossible to write a procedure to directly read image data and distinguish between many images. Furthermore, simpler ML  techniques such as the K Nearest Neighbors algorithm may have trouble making decisions in so many dimensions with such a complex output vector.

\subsection{Structure}
% TODO: This explanation is insufficient.
Neural Networks, on the other hand, make tasks like these easier by simulating how a physical brain makes decisions. Virtual neurons are chained together, which on their own only read the output values of each neuron in  Each network contains three types of layers:
\list
\item{Input Layers} - A vector of input values. Input data is fed through one or more "hidden layers," which multiply values by various weights (represented by \ howdoImakethewsign) in order to arrive at a final "output layer," which contains 

\subsection{Backpropogation}
A central component of neural network training is the backpropogation algorithm. In this 

\section{Language selection}
We chose for this research to use C++ for implementation of our deep Neural Network.
